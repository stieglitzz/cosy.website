        <p>It is hosted on a Raspberry Pi Zero W located in Melbourne, Victoria.</p>
        <p>That's pretty cool when you think about it. There's a tiny computer in my living room that lets me share
            things
            with other people through the internet.</p>
        <p>Is it secure? I dunno, sure hope sure.</p>
        <p>I'm assuming I will break it somehow and then this website will go offline but I guess that's part of it.</p>
