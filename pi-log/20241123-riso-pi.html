        <p>Raspberry Pis remind me of risograph machines.</p>
        <p>Sometimes they work.
            <br>
            Sometimes they don't.
            <br>
            Depends how they're feeling.
        </p>
        <p>I went out to run errands this morning and when I came home both raspypi and piBo were disconnected from my
            local network. They were connected just fine before I left!</p>
        <p>The good news is that I managed to physically connect them to my router and they are showing on the network!
        </p>
        <p>The connection setup is a bit convoluted because I only have one ethernet cable.</p>
        <p>I just spent the whole day drawing <a href="/pages/network-diagram.html">a diagram of my Pi network</a>.</P>
