        <p>I broke everything I setup on raspypi.</p>
        <p>So much confusion about ports. Then a light bulb moment that raspypi and piBo have different IP addresses
            which means that they can both use the default ports of 80 and 443. Then finding out my router does not
            allow virtual hosts to have the same port number even though they have different IP addresses. But this only
            applies to the external port, not internal...</p>
        <p>My brain is tired but I'm glad ChatGPT helped me to get this website online again. (Even though it assisted
            me in breaking raspypi in the first place.)</p>
        <p>It would be cool to have something monitoring uptime of my sites. I think I might need to run it on PiBo.
        </p>
        <p>It's time to try and get the other sites back up now.</p>
