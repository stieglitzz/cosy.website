        <p>I got my Raspberry Pi Zero, raspypi, on Thursday the 24th of October, 2024. That's about a month ago.</p>
        <p>It took me days to install and setup DietPi. I even emailed the shop I bought it from because I thought the
            microSD card might have been broken. (It wasn't.)</p>
        <p>My Raspberry Pi 4 8GB, piBo, arrived about an hour ago. piBo is already up and running! I referred to the
            notes I made when setting up raspypi and got everything setup on the first try!</p>
        <p>I'm typing this note because I want to acknowledge that Iam learning and improving. It might seem like a
            small thing but I'm chuffed it only tool me about an hour to setup a Pi instead of days!</p>

        <i>Update 4 hours later:</i>
        <p><i>I broke it. Lol. I coulnd't reboot or shutdown piBo because of an error related to <code>systemctl</code>
                and <code>dbus</code>. ChatGPT couldn't help me work out a solution so I decided to reflash the microSD
                card.</i></p>
        <p><i>
                It is tricky to reflash a microSD card with a Linux operating system when using a Windows computer. This
                was the main reason why it took me a week to setup raspypi. My problems reformatting the microSD card
                this time around was caused by a dodgy microSD card reader (which the microSD card got stuck in!).

                Anyway, onto attempt number 2.
