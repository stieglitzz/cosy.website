    <p>I think I need to start keeping a technical log of my Pi happenings. I make notes in Obsidian but I'm still
      confused about the concept of links, tags and folders.</p>
    <p>Things I would record are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>issues</li>
      <li>attempted resolutions</li>
      <li>succesful resolutions</li>
      <li>links resources and references used</li>
      <li>added services and software</li>
      <li>removed services and software</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Okay, this is just git commits. Maybe I should setup a private repo so I have version control for the Pi setups
      and won't have to nuke everything when I break it.</p>
    <p>This is the short list of Pi happenings today:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>continued setting up YunoHost on piBo</li>
      <li>tried to connect umm.lol to piBo</li>
      <li>umm.lol was loading a deleted, offline Homer dashboard but in a private browser it was loading <a
          href="https://cosy.website">cosy.website</a></li>
      <li>purging the Cloudflare cache for umm.lol stopped the Homer dashboard from loading</li>
      <li>currently umm.lol is still loading <a href="https://cosy.website">cosy.website</a></li>
      <li>when it does this the URL is https://umm.lol</li>
      <li>there is no valid SSL cert but the SSL cert for <a href="https://cosy.website">cosy.website</a> is listed</li>
      <li>remembered that I setup an Application Gateway through Cloudflare for umm.lol</li>
      <li>deleted Application Gateway</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Issues to try and fix next time:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>connect umm.lol to YunoHost</li>
      <li>resolve issues appearing in YunoHost diagnosis (DNS, port exposure, HTTP access and email)</li>
      <li>work out best way to manage port forwarding on my modem (Sagemcom 5366 TN)</li>
    </ul>
