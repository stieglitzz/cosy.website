        <h2><a href="https://tinyawards.net">Tiny Awards</a></h2>
        <p>A celebration of the small, personal & whimsical web. All the sites nominated are wonderful but if I have to
            pick
            some favourites... </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3><a href="https://diagram.website">Diagram Website</a></h3>
                <p>A collection within a collection. A giant venn diagram. A different way to present a directory.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3><a href="https://weexpire.org">WeExpire</a></h3>
                <p>Write a note for someone and they will receive it "after your death or if you are seriously injured".
                    I
                    don't know who I'd write my death note to or what I would.</p>
                <p><a href="death.html">One day I will write
                        more about death and digital legacy.</a> It's now something you have to consider leading up to
                    your
                    death, just like a will. Who will inherit your physical and digital objects?</p>
