        <p>I got my Raspberry Pi Zero, raspypi, on Thursday the 24th of October, 2024. That's about a month ago.</p>
        <p>It took me days to install and setup DietPi. I even emailed the shop I bought it from because I thought the
            microSD card might have been broken. (It wasn't.)</p>
        <p>My Raspberry Pi 4 8GB, piBo, arrived about an hour ago. piBo is already up and running! I referred to the
            notes I made when setting up raspypi and got everything setup on the first try!</p>
        <p>I'm typing this note because I want to acknowledge that Iam learning and improving. It might seem like a
            small thing but I'm chuffed it only tool me about an hour to setup a Pi instead of days!</p>
